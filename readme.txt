Sheets 'plate1' to 'plate5' contain raw data from five microplates used to monitor the growth conditions of Bifidobacterium under varying concentrations of four candidate pesticides. The data type of each column can be identified from the column name. All values are calculated using optical density and are presented without units. For more detailed information, please refer to the 'Methodology' section.
Sheets 'plate1-ana' to 'plate5-ana' present data on the Maximum Carrying Capacity and Growth Rate. These values are calculated based on data from 'plate1' to 'plate6.'
Sheets 'Spirotetramat', 'Fipronil', 'Glyphosate', and 'Cyhalothrin' contain growth data of Bifidobacterium, extracted and categorized from 'plate-ana' data under different concentrations of each pesticide.

Sheet 'evo1' provides the raw growth data of evolved Bifidobacterium cultured on Mega-Plate under varying concentrations of fipronil.
Sheet 'wild1' contains the raw growth data of wildtype Bifidobacterium under similar conditions.
Sheets 'evo1-ana' and 'wild1-ana' present Maximum Carrying Capacity and Growth Rate data calculated from the 'evo1' and 'wild1' datasets, respectively.
Sheets 'Mc1' and 'Gr1' contain Maximum Carrying Capacity and Growth Rate data, extracted from 'evo1-ana' and 'wild1-ana.'

Sheets 'plate2-1' to 'plate2-6' consist of raw data from six microplates used to monitor the growth conditions of six evolved Bifidobacterium strains cultivated from liquid media under various concentrations of fipronil.
Sheets 'plate2-x-ana' contain Maximum Carrying Capacity and Growth Rate data, calculated from 'plate2-x'.
Sheets 1 to 6 present data extracted and classified from 'plate2-x-ana,' categorized by six different concentrations of fipronil.

The 'survival' sheet provides raw data on the survival proportion of bumblebees.
